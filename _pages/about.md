I am a currently a first-year MS student of the <a href='https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/'>School of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/'>KAIST</a>, Republic of Korea. I am a member of <a href='https://cis.kaist.ac.kr/'>CIS Lab</a> and am working with Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/heejinahn/home'>Heejin Ahn</a>. My MS program is fully funded by <a href='https://www.cmkfoundation-scholarship.org/'>Hyundai CMK Scholarship (Future Industries Scholarship)</a>. Before that, I was a research officer at the Defense AI Center of the <a href='https://www.add.re.kr/eps'>Agency for Defense Development (ADD)</a>, the South Korean counterpart to the U.S. DARPA. I received my B.S. (Summa Cum Laude) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href='https://www.unist.ac.kr/'>Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)</a> in 2021.
